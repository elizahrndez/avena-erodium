#### Data and code to examine grass-forb coexistence in CA grassland

## Data cleaning
- Fall recruitment is read and cleaned in "recruitment_datasummary.R"
- Spring seed production is read and cleaned in "seeds_datasummary.R"
- Raw data are visualiuzed in "Fig1.R"

## Model fitting
- Mixed effect models are in "mixedeffectmodels.R" 
- Population models are in "models.R"

## Model projections
- Model simulation for constant conditions is in "modelsimulations.R"
- GRWR is visualized in "Fig2.R"
- Model simulations with historic rainfall is in "rainfallsimulations.R"
- Historic rainfall and predicted abundances are visualized in "Fig3.R"

### Partitioning Coexistence
- Coexistence is calculated in "invader_resident_comparison.R"" using the parameterized population models
- the results are visualized in the file "Fig4_invader_resident.R""
